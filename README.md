Note that the client calls the api right away, and since it takes a bit to boot up, try refreshing the page a couple of times if you don't see the tasks. 

To begin, install the dependencies: 

```
yarn install

```

## Serve it up

```
yarn run start

```

## Run the tests: 

```
yarn run test a

```
